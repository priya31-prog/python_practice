Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. 
One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the
plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

def average(array):
    # your code goes here
    new_heights = set(array)
    sumof = 0
    for i in new_heights:
        sumof +=i
        
    avg = sumof / len(new_heights)
    return avg
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
