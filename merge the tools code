There are three substrings of length  to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'.
The first substring is all 'A' characters, so A. The second substring has all distinct characters, so  BCA.
The third substring has  different characters, so DE. 
Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters encountered. 
The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.
