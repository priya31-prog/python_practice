The included code stub will read an integer,n , from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
123...n

Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between.

Example
n=5

Print the string 12345


solution:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = [str(x) for x in range(1,n+1)]
    output =''.join(arr)
    print(output)
