Note : 
if the list you are taking as integer as list of inputs 
means use map(int,input().split(' ')

to join the list of integers use
'\n'.join(map(str,listname))

Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in
ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that 
exist in either M  or N but do not exist in both.

solution

m = int(input())
a = set(map(int,input().split(' ')))
n = int(input())
b= set(map(int,input().split(' ')))

difference = a^b
new = sorted(difference)
print('\n'.join(map(str,new)))
