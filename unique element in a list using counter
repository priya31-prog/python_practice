Explanation

The list of room numbers contains 31 elements. Since K is 5, there must be 6 groups of families. 
In the given list, all of the numbers repeat 5 times except for room number .
Hence, 8 is the Captain's room number.

from collections import Counter

group_size = int(input())
room_number =list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
families = (len(room_number)-1)/group_size

number = [num for num,counter in Counter(room_number).items() if counter == 1][0]

print(number)
