problem

You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of 
 athletes and their details (such as age, height, 
weight and so on). You are required to sort the data 
based on the th attribute and print the final resulting table. 
Follow the example given below for better understanding.


Note that K  is indexed from  to M-1, where M is the number of attributes.

Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, 
for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, 
print the row that appeared first in the input.
